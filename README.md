# Shutdown_timer
This program will shutdown your machine after a specified time. 

I made this for myself to use to shutdown my computer while I am away. 

Having full disk encryption is very useful, however, if you leave your machine booted up while you are away, the disk will be left unencrypted. 
(My machine won't even boot without a flashdrive with the key on it inserted) 

### Use case examples:

- Rendering a project
- Installing a program
- Compiling code
- Downloading large files
- Uploading back up to the Cloud
